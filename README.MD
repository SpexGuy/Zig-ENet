# Zig-Enet

`enet.zig` provides Zig language bindings for version 1.3.16 of the ENet library.
To use, you will need to build ENet as a static library and link with it.
You will also need to link with the `winmm` library on windows.

If you can find a way to make `zig build` build the ENet library, PRs are welcome!
